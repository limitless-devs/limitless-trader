## limitless-trader

This repository contains two example scripts for trading on the Limitless Protocol. It depends on the [limitless-api-ts](https://github.com/limitless-devs/limitless-api-ts) package. 

The first is `example-trader.ts` which simply showcases the available functionality of the limitless-api.

The second, `random-trader.ts` is slightly more involved. It's geared towards devnet and makes use of the limitless token faucet program.
